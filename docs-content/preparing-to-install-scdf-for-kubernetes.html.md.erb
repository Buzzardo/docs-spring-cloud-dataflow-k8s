## <a id='app-container-registry'></a> Container Registry for App Images

Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes depends on a container image registry that contains the container images that will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.  Supported registries include Harbor, Google Container Registry (GCR), and Dockerhub.

If you are using Harbor as your container registry, ensure that it is deployed in your environment and is accessible at a domain name of your choice. The [VMware Harbor Registry tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/harbor-container-registry) is one option to deploy it when using Ops Manager.
