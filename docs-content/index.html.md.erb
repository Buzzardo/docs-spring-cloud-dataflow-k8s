This topic provides an overview of Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview


Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment lifecycle of streaming and batch data pipelines to Kubernetes.
The data pipelines are composed of Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task applications.
A streaming pipeline DSL and UI makes it easy to specify which apps to deploy and how to connect outputs and inputs.
The composed task DSL and UI is useful when a series of task apps must be run as a directed graph.
It is based on the Spring Cloud Data Flow open source project.
